"""Build fastsim_capstone/capstone_calo.ipynb — the full-day fast-sim capstone starter.

Project 2 of the generative track (see fastsim_capstone/CAPSTONE.md). Students spend the
day building the best **energy-conditioned calorimeter fast simulator** they can,
on the second data modality (calo showers): **CaloChallenge Dataset 2** —
GEANT4 electron showers, 1 GeV–1 TeV, each a 45x9x16 = 6480-voxel grid
(layers x radial x angular). This notebook is the *baseline starter*: it gets any
student to a first submission before lunch, then gets out of the way.

It reuses the week's machinery so nothing here is new tooling:
  * `src.data.load_calochallenge_ds2` — the REAL Dataset 2 (no synthetic fallback;
    run `python tools/prepare_data.py calochallenge` once first),
  * `src.diffusion.make_unet/_scheduler` — the energy-conditioned UNet (nb 04),
    here with the 45 detector layers as input channels,
  * `src.calo_eval.score_showers` — the scoring harness (the capstone's own),
  * cadence submission cells          — the friendly compare-and-discuss board.

Authoring contract is the same as the lesson notebooks: `##` heading per exercise,
exercise cells end on a primitive answer var, setup cells end on a print, and the
only cadence syntax is `# cadence:starter` / `# cadence:end`.

# 🏗️ Capstone — Calorimeter Fast Simulation

**Generative Modelling for HEP** — *full-day project (≈6h)*

Full detector simulation (Geant4) is the single biggest CPU cost in HEP: the LHC
experiments spend a huge fraction of their grid budget simulating **calorimeter
showers**. Your job today is to build a **generative fast simulator** — a model
that turns an **incident particle energy** `E_inc` (GeV) into a realistic
**calorimeter shower**, thousands of times faster than Geant4. This is exactly the
public **CaloChallenge** task.

We use **CaloChallenge Dataset 2**: GEANT4 **electron** showers with incident
energy log-uniform from **1 GeV to 1 TeV**. Each shower is a **6480-voxel grid**,
`45 layers × 9 radial × 16 angular` — a genuinely 3D energy deposit.

A good fast simulator:

- **conserves energy** sensibly — deposited energy tracks `E_inc`,
- reproduces **shower shapes** — longitudinal depth (which layers light up),
  lateral width (radial spread), sparsity,
- is **fast** — batch-samples thousands of showers per second,
- and is **indistinguishable** from real showers to a trained classifier.

**Architecture is your choice** — you've seen VAEs (01), GANs (02) and diffusion
(04). This starter ships a small **energy-conditioned diffusion baseline** (the
notebook 04 model, with the 45 layers as input channels) so you reach a first
submission fast; then you improve it.

### The day
| Block | Goal |
|---|---|
| **Baseline** | Get *any* conditional generator training + submitting. **First submission before lunch.** |
| **Improve** | Better architecture / conditioning / training; iterate against the metrics + your plots. |
| **Finalize** | Lock your best model; submit final metric + plots + a short reflection. |

> You complete the cells marked **Exercise**. Everything else runs as-is. Submit
> through the **cadence** cells at the end — we walk through the whole cohort's
> boards together at wrap-up. It's a friendly compare-and-discuss, not a ranked grind.

## Part A · The data, and a held-out reference

`load_calochallenge_ds2` returns `(showers, incident_energy)`: showers are
`(N, 45, 9, 16)` energy grids in **GeV** (layers, radial, angular), and
`incident_energy` is a 1-D array of incident energies in GeV. This is **real data
only** — run `python tools/prepare_data.py calochallenge` once to download and
skim Dataset 2 into `data/calochallenge_ds2.hdf5`; there is no synthetic fallback.

We split off a **reference** half — you never train on it; it's what you score
your generated showers *against* all day (the final grade recomputes the headline
metric on a separate held-out set server-side). Two preprocessing choices:

1. **Pad** the radial axis 9 → 16 so every layer is a 16×16 image — the diffusion
   UNet sees the 45 layers as 45 input **channels**. We crop back to 9 after sampling.
2. **log-normalise** the (huge dynamic range) energies to ~`[-1, 1]`, and **bin**
   the continuous incident energy into `N_EBINS` classes for the UNet's conditioning.

You have a baseline and a board submission — now beat it. Ideas, roughly in order
of effort:

- **Train more / bigger.** Raise `EPOCHS` and `N_LOAD`, widen `base_channels`,
  more sampling steps. The cheapest wins first.
- **Better conditioning.** More energy bins, or condition on the *continuous*
  energy instead of bins.
- **Respect the geometry.** The angular axis is **periodic** (it wraps) — try
  circular padding; or model the longitudinal profile explicitly.
- **A different architecture.** A conditional **VAE** or **GAN** on the same data
  — then compare head-to-head on the same metrics (great wrap-up material).
- **Physics-informed loss.** Add an energy-conservation penalty (deposited energy
  should track `E_inc`), or a sparsity penalty.
- **Quantify the speed-up.** Time your sampler in **showers/sec** vs a notional
  Geant4 baseline — the actual selling point of fast sim.

Every idea is judged by the *same* harness, so the metric tells you honestly
whether it helped.

- You submitted to the cohort board through **cadence** and reflected on what
